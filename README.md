ossia score is an interactive intermedia sequencer - read more on http://ossia.io, come ask questions on the [forum](http://forum.ossia.io/c/score) or hang out in a chat with us ! 

With *score* you can sequence OSC, MIDI, etc. parameters between multiple software and hardware, to create interactive and intermedia **score**s.

#### Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/releases/) and read the Releases section in this README.

## Contributing

When updating the score repository through the command line, don't forget to update the submodules, they change often.

    cd score
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Some useful and easy potential contributions are listed [on the website](http://ossia.io/contributing/).

There are also many fixable areas in the code : 

* [**TODO**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=TODO) : for general problems. Some are [five-minute fixes](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/blob/2e393a1786154c11d766e6c6476cc2bd5faa95d0/base/plugins/iscore-lib-process/Process/Style/ScenarioStyle.cpp#L3), other are [a multiple-day quest](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/blob/2e393a1786154c11d766e6c6476cc2bd5faa95d0/base/lib/core/plugin/PluginDependencyGraph.hpp#L67)
* [**FIXME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=FIXME) : for critical bugs / problems.
* [**MOVEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is not where it should be.
* [**REMOVEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=REMOVEME) : when something is redundant.
* [**RENAMEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=RENAMEME) : when the class does not match with the file it's in.
* [**OPTIMIZEME**](https://github.com/OSSIA/score/search?q=OPTIMIZEME) : when an easy-to-write-but-suboptimal algorithm is used.

Finally, one can write its own score plug-ins to add custom features to the software.
An example plug-in with the most common classes reimplemented is provided [here](https://github.com/OSSIA/iscore-addon-tutorial).
